About the program:
This first "release" maily focuses on the automatization of League tournaments using the built-in tools available on the Online Go Server (https://online-go.com).

Why SBtk?:
SBtk can mean whatever you want it to mean. For example, for me it means "Sunjang Baduk tool kit", but it was also meant as a joke, which I will leave to your imagination: feel free to find your own acronyms, and you might even convince me. Will it continue to be SBtk later on? that remains to be seen.

Creator (or Who is this "me" you talked about before?):
