It should only make sense to explain here what DEV_README is for.

Very simple, developer notes any developer should follow on the project. There is one for each directory, or at least there should be.
Developers may add/edit further notes as the project goes on.


By the way, the docs directory is for documentation, help, etc. Whatever files that should be openly accessible but that do not affect the program behavior (other than, perhaps, the display of the file per-se).
